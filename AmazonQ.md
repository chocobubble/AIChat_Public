# Amazon Q Integration

This document outlines the modifications made to the Gemini Chat CLI to make it work more like Amazon Q.

## Key Changes

1. **System Context Awareness**
   - Added functionality to gather system information
   - Implemented file system exploration capabilities
   - Enhanced command execution with context

2. **Tool-based Workflow**
   - Modified the chat flow to use a tool-based approach
   - Implemented tool call extraction and execution
   - Added support for multi-step reasoning

3. **Conversation Management**
   - Enhanced conversation state to track tool calls and results
   - Improved context management for follow-up queries
   - Added support for conversation history with tool outputs

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows this workflow:

1. User sends a query
2. The query is sent to the Gemini model with system prompt and conversation history
3. The model responds with text and/or tool calls
4. If tool calls are present:
   - The service executes the tool calls (file operations, bash commands, etc.)
   - The results are sent back to the model
   - The model provides a final response based on the tool results
5. The response is displayed to the user

This approach bridges the gap between the cloud-based AI model and the local environment, allowing the model to effectively work with local files and system information without requiring direct system access.
